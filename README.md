# Webpackage icubbles-ajax
This webpackage contains cubbles components to make single or multiple ajax request. Currently there are two components available:

### `<icubbles-ajax-request>`
Use this component if you want to make just a single ajax request.

### `<icubbles-ajax-multiple-request>`
Use this component if you want to make 2 or more request in parallel.

### Note
Under hood we are using the `axios` lib to make the requests. For proper request configuration see their [API docs](https://github.com/axios/axios).
